# codam_minitalk
The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals.
## ðŸ“‹ Testing
Compiling

To compile, go to the project path and run:

```shell
$ make
```
To test the program you just need to launch the "server" and the "client" in different shell tabs with the following:

```shell
$ ./server
```

This will show your PID to make the client work and will stay waiting to receive a message from the "client"

```shell
$ ./client "PID" "Your message string"
```
